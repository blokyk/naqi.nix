## Edited from /usr/share/doc/nano/examples/sample.nanorc (on normal systems, not nix)

## Make the 'nextword' function (Ctrl+Right) stop at word ends
## instead of at beginnings.
set afterends

## Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
## tabs and/or spaces as the preceding line -- or as the next line
## if the preceding line is the beginning of a paragraph.
unset autoindent # `autoindent` messes with system copy-paste :(

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.  Note that
## this overrides "quickblank".
set constantshow

## Remember the used search/replace strings for the next session.
set historylog

## Display line numbers to the left of the text.
set linenumbers

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
## Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
set mouse

## Switch on multiple file buffers (inserting a file will put it into
## a separate buffer).
set multibuffer

## Don't automatically add a newline when a file does not end with one.
set nonewlines

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
## beginning of the line.
set smarthome

## Enable soft line wrapping (AKA full-line display).
set softwrap

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.
set tabsize 4

## Convert typed tabs to spaces.
set tabstospaces

## Snip whitespace at the end of lines when justifying or hard-wrapping.
set trimblanks

## Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead
## of a single character, and without affecting the cutbuffer).
set zap

## Paint the interface elements of nano.  These are examples;
## by default there are no colors, except for errorcolor.
set titlecolor brightwhite,blue
set statuscolor brightwhite,blue
set errorcolor brightwhite,red
set selectedcolor brightwhite,cyan
set stripecolor ,yellow
set numbercolor brightmagenta
set keycolor brightgreen
set functioncolor brightyellow

## Setup of syntax coloring.

## If <Tab> should always produce four spaces when editing a Python file,
## independent of the settings of 'tabsize' and 'tabstospaces':
extendsyntax python tabgives "    "

## If <Tab> should always produce an actual TAB when editing a Makefile:
extendsyntax makefile tabgives "	"

## Key bindings.
